        <h4>Bread Dough:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
            <li>1 cup whole fat plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Garlic Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic granules</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, Italian seasoning,
                and salt in a boal; mix to combine.
            </li>
            <li>Dust work surface with more flour. Transfer dough to work surface.
                Knead dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the palm of your hand.
                Add more flour as needed to keep dough from being too sticky.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with
                parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
            </li>
            <li>Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench scraper, cut off
                8 wedges of dough. Roll each wedge of dough into a rope shape and
                tie into knots. Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the oven until knots are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil garlic granules, and
                parsley for topping in a small glass bowl. Brush mixture over the 
                warm knots.
            </li>
